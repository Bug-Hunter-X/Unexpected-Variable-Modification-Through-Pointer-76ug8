This repository contains a simple C program that showcases an unexpected variable modification through pointer manipulation. The program initializes an integer variable 'a' to 10 and then uses a pointer to modify its value. The unexpected behavior arises from the direct manipulation of memory location through pointer arithmetic. The solution provides a safer method to handle pointer operations to avoid unintended consequences.  The focus is on demonstrating a common error in C programming and providing a corrected approach.
